/// Calculates the number of unique paths a robot can take in an `m x n` grid
/// from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1).
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `m` - Number of rows in the grid.
/// * `n` - Number of columns in the grid.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns the number of unique paths as an `i32` integer. Note that the result
/// provided by this implementation is incorrect due to logical errors in the code.
///
/// # Warning
///
/// This function contains the following potential issues:
///
/// 1. The 2D vector `arr` is initialized with uninitialized capacities, and it does
///    not allocate storage for individual grid cells before attempted use.
/// 2. The initialization loop incorrectly attempts to set all values in `arr`
///    but fails due to unallocated inner vectors filled with garbage data.
/// 3. The logic to compute the number of unique paths is incomplete and flawed.
/// 4. The function violates Rust's safety guarantees by indexing uninitialized memory.
///
/// # Example (Hypothetical and Currently Incorrect)
///
/// ```
/// let paths = number_of_robots_path(3, 3);
/// assert_eq!(paths, 6); // This assertion will fail with current code.
/// ```
///
/// # Note
///
/// This implementation needs significant revisions to properly calculate the number
/// of unique paths. It should:
/// 1. Properly initialize and allocate the `arr` matrix with default values.
/// 2. Initialize the first row and column to represent boundary conditions.
/// 3. Correctly compute each cell value by summing paths from the top and left cells.

/**
 * Computes the minimum path sum to traverse a 2D grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
 *
 * # Arguments
 * - `grid` - A 2D vector of integers representing the grid where each cell contains a non-negative integer indicating the cost to enter that cell.
 *
 * # Returns
 * - An integer representing the minimum path sum from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1).
 *
 * # Constraints
 * - You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * # Example
 * ```
 * let grid = vec![
 *     vec![1, 3, 1],
 *     vec![1, 5, 1],
 *     vec![4, 2, 1]
 * ];
 * assert_eq!(min_path_sum(grid), 7);
 * ```
 *
 * # Details
 * The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum path sum:
 * - Define a 2D `dp` vector of the same size as the input grid, where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`.
 * - Initialize the first row and column of `dp` to accumulate sums along the respective grid edges, as there is only one possible path to these cells.
 * - Iterate through the rest of the grid, updating `dp[i][j]` to the sum of the current grid value (`grid[i][j]`) and the minimum value between the cell directly above (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the cell directly to the left (`dp[i][j-1]`).
 * - The result is stored in `dp[m-1][n-1]`.
 *
 * # Notes
 * - Assumes the input grid is not empty and has valid dimensions (`m > 0` and `n > 0`).
